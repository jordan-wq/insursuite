# Active Work Ledger

One row per in-flight task. Any session must check this before starting new work (see CLAUDE.md → Workflow → Session coordination), and keep it current: add an entry on start, update phase as work progresses, remove it on merge or abandonment.

| Topic slug | Worktree / branch | Phase | Started | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| staff-invite | `main` (not started) | designed | 2026-07-25 | Spec approved (`specs/2026-07-25-staff-invite-design.md`), no plan yet. Next unstarted work per CLAUDE.md. |

Resolved: the previously-unclaimed uncommitted changes to `app/login/page.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`, `app/staff/(shell)/layout.tsx`, `app/staff/login/page.tsx`, `middleware.ts` were committed to `main` as `c23ca7e` ("Fix staff login: move isAgent check out of Edge middleware into shell layout") — that was the admin-login fix from earlier this session, unrelated to admin-console-shell.
